  in 2015, and an MS and PhD in Biostatistics Florida State University.
   
   
Carlos is interested in statistical and mathematical problems geometric in nature, but 
entertains any interesting problems. He enjoys theoretical challenges as well as computational implementation.

  The pandemic has changed his non-academic interests greatly, but in general
  he is interested in rock climbing, comedy, gaming, music, and guitar (mainly 1970's to 1990's rock). 
  He has rock climbed in many states and hopes to continue to explore crags across the country.
  His favorite authors include Kurt Vonnegut, Neil Gaiman, and Manfredo P. Do Carmo.

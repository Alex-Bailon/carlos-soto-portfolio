  intro: `For his PhD at Florida State University, Carlos' advisor was Anuj Srivastava where he 
  applied statistical shape analysis to chromosomes and proteins. For his postdoc at
  Pennsylvania State University he is being co-advised by Matthew Reimherr and 
  Aleksandra (Seša) Slavkovic where he is working on extensions of differential privacy 
  to manifolds and shape spaces. Carlos is interested in statistical and mathematical 
  problems geometric in nature, but entertains any interesting problems. He enjoys 
  theoretical challenges as well as computational implementation.

	intro: ` "I hate math." That's the most common reaction I hear from people when I tell them what I do
			for a living. This reaction lives, rent-free, in my mind constantly. How is it that so many
			people dislike an entire subject that I find... well... beautiful? In most cases I have found
			it all boils down to one thing, how math is taught. In many cases people learn math algorithmically,
			which can be very tedious, rather than gaining the insight and intuition needed to 
			understand the reasoning behind algorithms. When writing lesson plans, I put intuition first 
			and details second. This may seem counterintuitive, but without intuition, I have found, students 
			never gain the motivation needed to follow through with the mathematics. This is at the core of 
			my teaching philosphy. For a more in-depth statement, please email me.
